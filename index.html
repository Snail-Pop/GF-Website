                As the set finally dipped just below the horizon, I gazed across the water which was shrouded by the newfound darkness. Walking alongside my boyfriend Tayvian, he held onto a small battery-powered lamp which barely illuminated our path. My friend Tate strolled along side us as we walked across the small sandy beach. The cool night air held a comforting warmth, it brushed against my skin as we made our way to a particularly thick portion of brush and bare trees.
                <br><br>
                My anxiety had been acting up beforehand, but despite my initial nerves - as this was my first camping trip without my parents with me – I found solace in the shared company of people that I fully trust. Their presence reassured me as I listened to the soothing rhythm of the current conversation, we had been talking about how beautiful of a campsite we were at, and how we had to go through a bit of hell to finally get there. As we continued pushing through the branches of trees and jumping over logs, Tayvian spotted a particularly spacious log in a small clearing ahead. We were all feeling like taking a break, so we quickly made our way over and sat down on the log.
                <br><br>
                As I sat down against the rough weathered wood, I nestled against Tayvian, being next to him made even the hardest of logs immediately 10x more comfortable. It was a warm summer night, so the only chill came from a gentle breeze drifting in from the nearby water. Amidst the lapping of waves against the shore, Tayvian and Tate’s voices painting the beach with a warm and inviting conversation. We stayed on the log for a little while, basking in the simplicity of our togetherness that evening. But eventually Tate got tired, as did the rest of us, so he invited us to head back to our tent.
                <br><br>
                We stood up from our makeshift bench and I quickly grasped Tayvian’s soft hoodie, despite the lamp that he held, I relied on his guidance through the darkness. The only noise you could hear as we walked back to our tent was the soft sound of our steps in the sand and the rhythm of the waves caressing the shoreline.

                In the book The Electric Kingdom our main characters eventually meet each other in a serene, wooded forest, most of them had lost their parents so they were on their own. Despite their uncertain situation, they’re able to find solace in the company of each other – even though most of them have just met -. It’s a true show that humans are always able to find some sort of comfort in the presence of other humans, or dogs too, in the case of this book. Even in a post-apocalyptic world full of distrust and fear, people are able to cling to the warmth found in shared conversations and companionship.
                <br><br>
                A lot of the characters are able to briefly forget about their current hostile situation to focus on the fun that they’re having with their newfound friends. They need to keep moving to stay safe, so they spend most of their time walking and talking the way that any other person would do. Even when things get tough, they’re able to help each other along the way to the best of their abilities.

                I stirred from an accidental nap, drenched in sweat, feeling the stifling heat from inside Tayvian’s car. I picked up my phone to check what time it was, hoping that maybe we were almost to the campsite. As I looked out the passenger window, I noticed that we were parked on the side of a busy freeway. Immediately confusion started to cloud my mind upon realizing the fact that we weren’t anywhere near the campsite, and even more so that nobody else was in the car with me. The radio hummed tunes through the empty car as I glanced through the windshield, spotting Tayvian, his dad, and Tate outside. Tayvian’s dad had been driving his truck with a boat towed on the back, Tayvian and his dad were fiddling with a tire while Tate sat crouched investigating a light on the trailer.
                <br><br>
                I waited patiently as everyone finished helping put on what appeared to be a spare tire, I felt a little bit unhelpful, but in my defense I had been asleep.
            <div><img class="hidableImage" src="assets/images/image3.png" alt="image3.png"></div>
            <p id="mainText">
                We finally made it to a discount tire to deal with our little problem, Tayvian’s dad said we’d be there for a while but gave us a task to use up our time. The tire was being dealt with, but the trailer light still demanded some immediate attention. So, tasked with a mission, Tayvian, Tate, and I began to walk alongside a bustling road in the lovely – scorching.. - town of Fife Washington. It was fun at first, but the oppressive heat began to weigh on us as we walked, Tayvian had told me that there was a lake at the campsite, I just wanted to be in it already.
                <br><br>
                It was a short walk, but the minutes began to feel like an eternity beneath the scorching sun, of course I hadn’t put on my sunscreen yet. We finally reached the O’Reilly’s store, immediately welcomed by the cool blast of the air conditioning. My anxiety began to gnaw at me as a few people glanced our way, I knew it was just my nerves, but I felt really far from home. I shadowed Tayvian and Tate as they walked through the aisles, their conversation became a distant hum as I was focused on my growing anxiety and hunger. Of course in the end they didn’t have the right kind of light bulb, so we had to walk back empty-handed.
                <br><br>
                The trip back felt even longer than the journey to the store, it was completely and utterly disheartening to return with the news that we didn’t find anything. I hadn’t eaten since early morning either, so the hunger pains were starting to get worse. Tayvian’s dad promised us we could get some food while he figured out what to do about the taillight. Finally sometime later, we were able to eat and resume our journey. The rest of the ride was full of early 2000s music and winding through breathtaking landscapes. The reward was imminent as we finally pulled into the campground, greeted by Tayvian’s extended family, marking the end of our agonizingly long journey.

                I woke up to the commotion of everyone at the campsite moving things around, signaling the unfortunate end of the camping excursion. Sunlight had begun to pierce through the fabric of my tent, hitting my face almost directly. Despite the intrusive brightness, I stubbornly attempted to roll over, hoping that I could get away with a few more minutes of rest. I was on an inflatable mattress under about 4 separate blankets, the warmth was practically begging me to stay put.
                <br><br>
                To my right, Tate had begun to pack up his belongings, an action that I could hardly muster the energy to emulate. Meanwhile, Tayvian was in his grandfather’s RV most likely brushing his teeth. The minutes ticked by as I feigned slumber, hoping to delay the inevitable departure. Soon enough Tayvian unzipped the tent, and sat down on the air mattress that we had been sharing for the past few days. My expression must have mirrored my inner grouchiness as he urged me to get up. Reluctantly, I sighed and relinquished the refuge of my soft blankets and grudgingly dragged myself up. The morning air bit with an unwelcome chill, which didn’t make things any easier for me.
                I got into Tayvian’s car and quickly settled in for the long drive ahead, the remnants of our camping adventure were packed snugly in the trunk. Now that I was awake, the cold air bestowed a sense of serenity, sparing us from the heat that would soon return. As I peered through the car window, I glanced back at the vacant patch of grass where our tent had sat for the past few days. I was sad to leave, but happy to think about the various things that we had done since we got here.

            <p id ="mainText">    
            Tate soon slid into the backseat as Tayvian said his goodbyes to the rest of his extended family. Neither of us were upset, but our fatigue left us silent as we both sat in the car. I began to absentmindedly scroll through my TikTok page, seeking a distraction while I waited for Tayvian to get into the car. A TikTok notification from my mom interrupted my scrolling, I tapped to see if she had sent me another video as she did earlier that morning. As the screen showed our dms, my heart dropped. The contentment of the morning had been abruptly shattered by the contents of her message.
                <br><br>
                It is sooooo True! Also I am pretty sure after today your dad and I will be starting the divorce process sooner than later 
                <br><br>
                The first part had been in response to a message I sent earlier, but nothing could have prepared me for the second half. In fact, the message went on way longer than that short segment, but I couldn’t continue reading in my shocked state. The weight of what she had told me hit like a sudden blow, wrenching me from the tranquil bubble of our camping trip. I looked up from my phone, my mind was still struggling to process what I had just read, the happy moments of the morning had faded into feelings of shock and disbelief. Tayvian entered the car and began a warm conversation with Tate, but to me the car felt suffocating as I tried to figure out how I could even respond to a message like that.
